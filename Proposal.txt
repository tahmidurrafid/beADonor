BeADonor
Introduction:
This system will provide donation service. There will exist collaborations between both type of people
who will donate and who needs donations. This will run as charitable and non profit organization. On our 
webapp, moderators will work as a bridge between the donors and the people who seek help.
Our system will provide the opportunity for all sorts of donations. For example, there will be
    blood donation, 
    old and unused clothes(specially in winter Season) will be collected and distrubuted among the people who need
    People can ask for financial support for critical medical issues. Our moderator will verify their documents
        and then the post will be visible to the donors. 
    Users will submit details of their unused study materials(books/bags/calculator ...), gadgets(phone/laptop)
        and other tools. Our moderator will review and pick up goods from their location or ask them
        send through courier(depending upon the distance)
    Users can pay their Zakat, fitrah to us and we will distribute maintaining proper religious law.
    To draw the attention of the users, we have decided to add some points to user account after every donation
        which can be redeemed to get T-shirts or some other cool staffs.
    There will be dashboard where a list of weekly/monthly best donors will be visisble (every user will
        have the choice to make his donation visible/hidden)
    Users can provide us information about the people who need financial help(As most of them might not be able 
        to ask help through our webapp themselves)
    Admin will monitor the activitied of the moderators.
    User can be an individual or an organization.
