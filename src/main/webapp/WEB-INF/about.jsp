                There are always some people who prefer to provide help and support to those in need. The
                needy people can be helped in many ways. They cannot afford proper food, education and
                proper medical treatment. Often the people who are willing to help cannot reach to the needy
                people directly. Not only the poor people but also the rich ones sometimes become
                depending on others help. Finding effective ways to retain blood/plasma donors is crucial
                especially in this current Covid situation. Now a days, it is a very common in social media to
                see people asking for financial help for people in critical medical condition. But sometimes it
                becomes difficult to verify properly as there are a lot of frauds. So often the actual needy
                people don't get proper support.

                So our primary goal is to build a platform where donors can help the needy ones. Users can
                donate on specific category or to a specific request as they wish. Our moderator will verify
                help seeking requests and payment confirmation.
